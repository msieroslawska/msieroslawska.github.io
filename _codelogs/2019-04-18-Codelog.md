## Plan for the day

- [ ] Work on a HTML + CSS project from FE class, possibly finish it.
- [ ] Continue watching [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/).

## Learned today

- I completely forgot how to center an image with CSS. No, it's not `text-align: center` :)

```css
.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```
