## Plan for the day

- [x] Start an outline of TODOs and skills I would like to read about next. It's hard to stay focused with so many online resources. It is necessary to prioritize!
- [x] Start logging my programming progress! I found this idea on [dev.io](https://dev.io), its author is [codeidoscope](https://github.com/codeidoscope), kudos! I constantly struggle with imposter syndrome, even though I am perfectly aware it does not make sense.
- [x] Figure out how to attach a global TODO list to all my codelogs. I do not want to plan what I'm gonna do exactly *the next day*, as I don't want to commit myself to daily work. I've tried that and for a while it works great until I lose the schedule and feel constantly guilty about not sticking to it. It's supposed to be fun and helpful, not a chore!

## Learned today

- Piping Jekyll layouts was easier than expected. For some reason initially my mind was looping over it without understanding!
- I had to double check how to create checkboxes in vanilla HTML. Using markdown spoils you!
- You can indeed parameterize your templates! (see [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/#passing-parameters-to-includes))
