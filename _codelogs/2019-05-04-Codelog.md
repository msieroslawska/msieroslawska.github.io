### CSS units

#### Absolute

- *cm* / *mm*: centi- and milimiters,
- *in*: inches (1in = 96px = 2,54cm),
- *px*: pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in),
- *pt*: points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in),
- *pc*: picas (1pc = 12 pt).

#### Relative

(**Viewport** = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm)

- *em*: relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font),
- *ex*: relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used),
- *ch*: relative to width of the "0" (zero),
- *rem*: relative to font-size of the root element,
- *vw*: relative to 1% of the width of the viewport,
- *vh*: relative to 1% of the height of the viewport,
- *vmin*: relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension,
- *vmax*: relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension,
- *%*: relative to the parent element.
