## Plan for the day

- [x] Finish watching [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/).
- [x] Start watching - [ ] [Mastering Chrome Developer Tools, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/chrome-dev-tools-v2/) by Jon Kuperman. Master your devtools!

## Learned today

- You can pipe stuff in Shell into the clipboard, e.g. `cat index.html | pbcopy`.
- I have finished the "Complete intro to web development" class! It was well-structured and nicely presented. Definitely worth checking out to cover the basics -- even though I thought I knew the topics, I did learn new tricks from each video! That being said, the one part which was relatively new to me was *node* and creating your own web server. I'm going to definitely add it to my list of TODOs!
