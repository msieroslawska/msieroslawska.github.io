## Plan for the day

- [x] Continue watching [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) by Will Sentance
- [x] Start watching [Getting Started with JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/) by Kyle Simpson

## Learned today

#### How do we avoid repeating ourselves? (c.d.)

3. `new` operator

  ```javascript
  function userCreator(name, score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }

  userCreator.prototype // {}
  userCreator.prototype.increment = function() {
    this.score++;
  }

  let user1 = userCreator('Will', 6);
  ```

  Using **new** automates 2 things: creating a new object and returning it. The new object does not have a custom label anymore. Instead, it is referred to as **this**.

  It also creates a bond to `UserCreator`'s `prototype` where it stores all the shared properties (instead of `userFunctionStore` from previous examples).

  JS functions are just objects with an extra `call` method being invoked when a function is called.

  ```javascript
  function User(name, score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }

  User.prototype.increment = function() {
    this.score++;
  }

  User.prototype.login = function() {
    console.log('Login');
  }

  let user = new User('Eva', 10);
  user.increment();
  ```

  1. `new` creates an empty object and assigns it to a label `this`.
  2. `__proto__` from `this` is linked to `User.prototype`.
  3. There is no need for explicit return, `new` returns object labeled as `this`.

  If we call `User` without `new` it will not work. `this` will be pointing to the global object. As this syntax looks just like another function, it's easy to forget that it requires `new`.

4. `Class` syntactic sugar

  Solution 3 does not allow the following syntax:

  ```javascript
  function User(name, score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
    this.increment = function() {
      this.score++;
    }
  }
  ```

  By using `Class` we can introduce a *constructor* which will be a collection of all the methods and properties.

  ```javascript
  class User {
    constructor(name, score) {
      this.name = name;
      this.score = score;
    }

    increment() {
      this.score++;
    }

    login() {
      console.log('Login');
    }
  }

  let user = new User('John', 14);
  user.increment();
  ```
