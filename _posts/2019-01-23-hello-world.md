The topics I want to cover in the future (a.k.a. blog TODO):

* mastering Git (like, **really** mastering, become a Rebase Master),
* what's the deal with *this*??
* summary of good practices in React,
* `const` vs. `let` vs. `var`,
* Linter rules (and why you should be using Linter in the first place),
* why do I always break `npm` and what is `package.json`,
* just bite *node*, even just a little, just try,
* transpiling, do I even use it?
