The topics I want to cover in the future (a.k.a. blog TODO):

* mastering Git (like, **really** mastering, become a Rebase Master),
* what's the deal with *this*??
* summary of good practices in React,
* `const` vs. `let` vs. `var`,
* Linter rules (and why you should be using Linter in the first place),
* why do I always break `npm` and what is `package.json`,
* just bite *node*, even just a little, just try,
* transpiling, do I even use it?
* `Object.prototype`,
* passing via value / reference,
* closures,
* classes,
* shallow vs. deep copy,
* class property syntax,
* setters and getters,
* `*.es` vs. `*.js`,
* proxies,
* documenting functions,
* `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`.
