## Plan for the day

- [x] Continue watching [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) by Will Sentance

## Learned today

### Asynchronous JS

This works as expected, `Hey!` prints first, `Hello` prints at least 1000 ms later.

```javascript
function printHello() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

setTimeout(printHello, 1000);
console.log('Hey!`);
```

But this? It also prints `Hey!` first and `Hello` after that, why??

```javascript
function printHello() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

setTimeout(printHello, 0);
console.log('Hey!`);
```

So far we've been using the following components:

1. Thread of execution
2. Variable environment
3. Call stack

To understand this, we need to add 3 more components:

1. Web browser APIs / Node background threads
2. Callback / Message / Task queue
3. Event loop

#### Browser API

JS is running in an environment which is able to spin up more threads than just one, including setting up a timer. These features are not part of JS, hence we call them APIs.

In the example above, `setTimeout` does not call `printHello`. It communicates with the browser API telling it to start a timer. After it counts down to 0, it pushes `printHello` to the call stack.
