## Learned today

### Callback queue

```javascript
function printHello() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

function blockFor1Sec() {
  //
}

setTimeout(printHello, 0);
blockFor1Sec();
console.log('Me first');
```

If the engine is busy executing a function (`blockFor1Sec`) and in the meantime `setTimeout`'s timer is done, then `printHello` is going to be added to **callback queue**. Anything in that queue is going to be pushed to call stack once it's **empty** and the global execution context has finished all its tasks (`console.log('Me first)`). And in our example, even though our `setTimeout` timer was set to 0, it was only executed after 1s.

The process of checking if call stack is ready to get anything from the callback queue and pushing to it is called **event loop**.

There are many things where waiting would block our thread and we are using browser APIs instead:

- a timer to finish running,
- new information from server (Ajax),
- indication that a protion of a page has loaded,
- user interaction (clicks, mouseovers, etc.),
- writing / reading to file system (node),
- writing / reading database (node).

### `XMLHttpRequest`

```javascript
function display(data) {
  console.log(data.post);
}

$.get('http://twitter.com/willsen/tweet/1', display);
console.log('Me first');
```

In the example above we only log the data, but there is no way to store it / pass into a variable. We could add another function inside `display` which would parse the data, but that leads to callback hell.
