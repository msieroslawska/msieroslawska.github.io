## Plan for the day

- [x] Work on a HTML + CSS project from FE class, ~~possibly finish it~~.
- [x] Continue watching [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/).

## Learned today

- I completely forgot how to center an image with CSS. No, it's not `text-align: center` :)

  ```css
  .center {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    width: 50%;
  }
  ```

- VSCode has integrated Emmet which can be **so** helpful! Typing: `section.main-header.story*2>lorem:50` and then pressing `Tab` will automatically create two `section` elements with classes `main-header` and `story` containing *Lorem ipsum* which is 50 words long. How awesome is that?!
- Scoping in Javascript: I already knew that `let` and `const` are block-scoped, but I'd like to note down the following behavior:

  ```javascript
  let x = 1;

  function f() {
    x = 2;
  }

  console.log(x); // 1
  f();
  console.log(x); // 2
  ```

  At a first glance, I would say `x` preserves its original value, as the `x = 2` assignment should only be "visible" within the function scope, and that's **not** true!
