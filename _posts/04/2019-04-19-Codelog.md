## Plan for the day

- [x] Finish the HTML + CSS project.
  - It's available here: [../../projects/web-dev/01-The-news-times/index.html](../../projects/web-dev/01-The-news-times/index.html)
- [x] Continue watching [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/).

## Learned today

- I watched more of Brian's videos about JS fundamentals to make sure I am not missing anything. He mentioned there is a quite clever pattern to avoid `this` rabbit hole for objects. Instead of making `getName` a function inside the object:

  ```javascript
  const me = {
    name: {
      first: 'Brian',
      last: 'Holt',
    }
    getName() {
      return `My name is ${this.name.first} ${this.name.last}.`
    }
  }
  ```

  why not just declare it as a separate function in global scope and pass the object?

  ```javascript
  const me = {
    name: {
      first: 'Brian',
      last: 'Holt',
    }
  }

  getName(person) {
    return `My name is ${person.name.first} ${person.name.last}.`
  }
  ```

- Finishing the first HTML / CSS project made me realize how hard `flex` can be. I need way more practice with this.
- If you want to add an element on the first place in an array, you use `Array.prototype.unshift()`. Not the easiest to remember, I know. But somehow somebody thought that removing the first element would be `Array.prototype.shift()` and tried to maintain the logic.
