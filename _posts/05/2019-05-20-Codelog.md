## Plan for the day

- [x] Copy resources link from codelogs to a separate page. Handy for the future.
- [ ] Implementation of a calendar-style archive for codelogs
  - [x] Figure out how to marry Jekyll and vanilla JS
  - [ ] Populate the page with a full calendar using just JS
  - [ ] Add hyperlinks for dates where codelogs exist
  - [ ] Style everything nicely in CSS, maybe with a dropdown selection for months
  - [ ] Add buttons for prev / next / show all simplified list, etc.

## Learned today

Jekyll's Liquid format is a weird monstrosity when coupled with pure JS. Technically this works:

```javascript
let posts = [];
{% for log in site.posts %}
  day = {{ log.date | date: '%d' }}
  month = {{log.date | date: '%m'}}
  year = {{log.date | date: '%Y'}}
  posts.push({day, month, year});
{% endfor %}
```

I hope extracting post dates can be done in a less cringy way :|
