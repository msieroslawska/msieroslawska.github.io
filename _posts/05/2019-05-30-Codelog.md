## Plan for the day

- [x] Finish watching [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) by Bianca Gandolfo
- [x] Start watching [JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/) by Will Sentance

## Learned today

### Higher order functions

These are functions that operate on other funtions, by taking them as arguments and/or by returning them.

```javascript
const ifElse = ({ condition, ifTrue, ifFalse }) => {
  return condition : ifTrue() ? ifFalse();
};

ifElse({
  true,
  () => console.log(true),
  () => console.log(false)
})
```

### `reduce()`

```javascript
_.reduce([1, 2, 3], (sum, n) => sum + n, 0 ); // 6
```

### Closures

```javascript
const counter = () => {
  let n = 0;
  return {
    count: () => n + 1;
    reset: () => n = 0;
  }
};

myCounter = counter();
myCounter.count();          // 1
myCounter.count();          // 2
myCounter.count();          // 3

anotherCounter = counter();
anotherCounter.count();     // 1
anotherCounter.count();     // 2

myCounter.reset();          // 0
anotherCounter.count();     // 3
```

### Running / calling / invoking a function

Unless the function is called, JS engine does **not** initialize anything from the function's body.

As soon as we start executing the code, we create a *global execution context* consisting of:

- thread of execution,
- live memory of variables with data (*Global Variable Environment*).

When you execute a function you create a new execution context comprising:

- the thread of the execution (we go through the code **in the function** line by line),
- a local memory, where everything defined in the function is stored.
