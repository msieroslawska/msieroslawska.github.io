## Plan for the day

- [x] Work on vanilla JS calculator from [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) class.
  - [x] Add button listeners *only* for digits (not result element).
  - [x] Figure out orange background class for operators.
  - [ ] My `tempValue` and operator handlers store everything with one step (click) delay :( Good thing I'm more familiar with the debugger!
- [x] Continue watching - [Mastering Chrome Developer Tools, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/chrome-dev-tools-v2/) by Jon Kuperman.

## Learned today

### CSS units

#### Absolute

- *cm* / *mm*: centi- and milimiters,
- *in*: inches (1in = 96px = 2,54cm),
- *px*: pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in),
- *pt*: points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in),
- *pc*: picas (1pc = 12 pt).

#### Relative

(**Viewport** = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm)

- *em*: relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font),
- *ex*: relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used),
- *ch*: relative to width of the "0" (zero),
- *rem*: relative to font-size of the root element,
- *vw*: relative to 1% of the width of the viewport,
- *vh*: relative to 1% of the height of the viewport,
- *vmin*: relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension,
- *vmax*: relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension,
- *%*: relative to the parent element.

### Profiling *node.js*

You usually start running the server by `npm start`, but it is just a shortcut to a command defined in *package.json* (e.g. `node server/index.js`). This command can be run directly which enables also adding additional flags, e.g. `node --inspect server/index.js`. It starts the server as usual, but it also shows extra debugging option in Dev Tools.
