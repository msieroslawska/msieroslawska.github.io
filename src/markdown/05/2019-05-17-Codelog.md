## Plan for the day

- [x] Continue watching [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) by Bianca Gandolfo
  - First opinion after starting the serious part: I wish she used a code editor / browser more ofthen than slides, they too static. And picked up the pace, as I'm watching it at 1,4x - 1,6x speed :(

## Learned today

- Everything that uses a dot in JS is an object.
- JS always passes by value, but in case of objects the value of the variable is a reference:

  Value (primitive):

  ```javascript
  let a = { x: 1 };
  let b = a.x;
      a.x = 2;
  console.log(a); // { x: 2 }
  console.log(b); // 1
  ```

  Reference (object):

    ```javascript
  let c = { y: 1 };
  let d = c;
      c.y = 2;
  console.log(a); // { y: 2 }
  console.log(b); // { y: 2 }
  ```

- Array as just objects with some extra methods on them. Pretty basic, right? So what about this example:

  ```javascript
  let a = []];
      a.x = 2;
  console.log(a); // []
  ```

  I'm **guessing** here we're assigning something to `x` property of an array, not appending to its contents and that's why we still get an empty array (another suspicion is that maybe `a` got coerced to a regular object).

  - Array indices are weird.

  ```javascript
  let a = [];
      a[10] = 'x';
  console.log(a.length); // 11 <--- WHAAAAT
  ```
