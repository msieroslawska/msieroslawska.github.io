## Plan for the day

- [x] Use the post functionality for my codelogs. I think I my brain has temporary turned into jelly when I decided to use collections for that. Why did I try to reinvent the wheel?

## Learned today

CSS has a functionality to add filters to images. If for any reason you don't want to either use *HSV* color model or SaSS and its `darken` and `lighten`, you can control the darkness by:

```css
  filter: brightness(50%);
```

`0%` makes the image completely black and `100%` is the image original state.

Other helpful filters are:

- `blur`,
- `contrast`,
- `grayscale`,
- `invert`,
- `opacity`,
- `saturate`.
