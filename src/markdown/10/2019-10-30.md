For some bizzare reason I have decided to reanimate this project and continue my work with Gatsby. Thanks to my new awesome job, I am getting familiar with Typescript, so hey, why not use it here?

Good riddance, what a stupid idea that was.

I am writing this quick note right now, so I can incorporate my rants later into blog post list.

It took me **FOREVER** to setup the project. Mostly because I have decided I want to work on my old config.

(*Yet another stupid idea this evening...*)

After at least an hour of setting up `npm<`, I ended up removing most of config files and setting up everything basically from scratch. No Gatsby starters. Good luck typing those without having any idea what is happening.

The most important highlight of the day: do not open multiple projects in VSCode if you do not install `eslint` globally. You will save hours without having to figure out why it **CONSTANTLY** complains about not being able to find plugins.
