I feel it's redundant to write both here in Codelogs and in the challenge description file, hence the break in my Codelogs calendar.</p>\n<p>I've been pointed to another <a href=\"http://codekata.com/\">challenge resource</a> and today I started working on a different approach. I'm working on implementing binary search using different approaches <strong>and</strong> running unit tests at the same time. So far I have a working test setup (with failing tests! TDD FTW!) and some basic code.</p>\n<p>One issue (error) I have encountered so far is calculating the division index for arrays with odd number of elements. I forgot index has to be an integer and it's necessary to round up the division result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> dividerIdx = arr.length % <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span> === <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> ? arr.length / <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span> : <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Math</span>.floor(arr.length / <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>) + <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>;</code></pre>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
