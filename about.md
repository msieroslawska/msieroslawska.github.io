![Me](../assets/img/marta.jpg#about-picture)

I am a silly geek born and raised in Poland, currently enjoying my life and trying to speak German in Munich, Germany. I am stereotypical to the bone: I like books, video games and quiet evenings at home, sharing my couch with Arya the Corgi. If we don't stay indoors we go for hikes or travel around.

I used to be a Linux power user, but I betrayed the penguin for the sake of the popular fruit.
Life ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Professionally I have become a bit of Jack of all trades. While I always enjoyed playing with code, I have initially decided to proceed on a path of testing. I pay great attention to detail (yes, I *know* my picture is not centered!) and enjoy hunting for bugs. All of this creates quite a combo: I develop, test it manually, write automation scripts and every now and then dab in CI/CD. I believe being on the both sides of the dev - QA field gives me an interesting perspective.

On my daily basis I am working with:

* JavaScript + ES6 + Mocha,
* React,
* HTML + CSS + Sass + Handlebars,
* Jenkins + Groovy,
* Git,
* Jira.

In the past I played around with (results were not always worth mentioning):

* Python,
* Java,
* Assembler,
* SQL,
* Selenium.
