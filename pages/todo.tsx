        summary="it was one of the weakest FM classes I've seen so far. Having an interactive style of teaching which involves the students present in the room is beneficial to them, but slows down the pace of the recording. I'd rather be given facts and examples by the teacher than to listen to students trying to figure out the question. I also think that some concepts were not explained very well (curring or closures). If I've never heard of it before, I'd be even more confused."

I'm glad I interjected my JS learning path with this class, because I'm no longer at mercy of `console.log` (it still has its use!)!
