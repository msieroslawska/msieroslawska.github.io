Why do I bother with overcomplicated setups?

Deploying to Netlify was as simple as:

1. Creating a Netlify account (don't forget to add 2FA!)
2. Connecting with Github and authorizing Netlify to access my website repo
3. Adding a `netlify.toml` file in the root directory of my repo:

```
[build]
  command = "npm run build && npm run export"
  publish = "out"
```

4. Making sure `package.json` has an export script:

```
scripts: {
  "export": "next export"
}
```

5. Adding basic build settings in Netlify's dashboard

(Everything is beatifully explained [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/04/building-a-markdown-blog-with-next-9.4-and-netlify/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=next101mdblog-cs&utm_campaign=devex))

6. Optionally, changing the domain (I'm not sure if I want a custom one, so far I'll stay with [marta.netlify.app](marta.netlify.app))
