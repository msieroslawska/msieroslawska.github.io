Since I have decided to deploy my page using Netlify, I wanted to have a nice page redirect coming from old github.io address. The solution was not a hard one: I compiled it from [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/permanently-redirect-github-pages)
and [this](https://dev.to/steveblue/setup-a-redirect-on-github-pages-1ok7) articles.

TL;DR;

1. If not public already, setup the repo to be public (otherwise github pages build will not be available).
2. Create `index.html` in the root directory, updating the URLs as necessary:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://marta.netlify.com" />
    <link rel="canonical" href="https://marta.netlify.com" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The page been moved to <a href="https://marta.netlify.com">https://marta.netlify.com</a></h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Create `_config.yml` file in the root directory, just to set up dummy theme for Jekyll:

```
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
```

4. Commit, push, wait for build & publish.
