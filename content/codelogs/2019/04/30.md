## Plan for the day

- [x] Work on vanilla JS calculator from [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) class.

## Learned today

I started working on the calculator by getting HTML and CSS setup first. This is the current visual state:

Obviously this is nothing great. I have issues with `flex` and aligning items; I also need to figure out how to stretch the buttons to get 100% coverage of background color. :(

I think I might read about `grid` more, because something tells me this would be way easier.

## Resources list

- [Centering a block horizontally and vertically](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/#center-horizontally-and-vertically)
- [The best and only guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) (I get back to it constantly!)
