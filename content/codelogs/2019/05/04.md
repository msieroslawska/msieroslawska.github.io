## Plan for the day

- [x] Work on vanilla JS calculator from [Complete Intro to Web Development, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/) class.
  - [x] Add button listeners _only_ for digits (not result element).
  - [x] Figure out orange background class for operators.
  - [ ] My `tempValue` and operator handlers store everything with one step (click) delay :( Good thing I'm more familiar with the debugger!
- [x] Continue watching - [Mastering Chrome Developer Tools, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/chrome-dev-tools-v2/) by Jon Kuperman.

## Learned today

### CSS units

#### Absolute

- _cm_ / _mm_: centi- and milimiters,
- _in_: inches (1in = 96px = 2,54cm),
- _px_: pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in),
- _pt_: points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in),
- _pc_: picas (1pc = 12 pt).

#### Relative

(**Viewport** = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm)

- _em_: relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font),
- _ex_: relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used),
- _ch_: relative to width of the "0" (zero),
- _rem_: relative to font-size of the root element,
- _vw_: relative to 1% of the width of the viewport,
- _vh_: relative to 1% of the height of the viewport,
- _vmin_: relative to 1% of viewport's\* smaller dimension,
- _vmax_: relative to 1% of viewport's\* larger dimension,
- _%_: relative to the parent element.

### Profiling _node.js_

You usually start running the server by `npm start`, but it is just a shortcut to a command defined in _package.json_ (e.g. `node server/index.js`). This command can be run directly which enables also adding additional flags, e.g. `node --inspect server/index.js`. It starts the server as usual, but it also shows extra debugging option in Dev Tools.
