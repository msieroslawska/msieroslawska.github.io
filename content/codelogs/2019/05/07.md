## Plan for the day

- [x] Start writing an article about JS data types (available [here](/blog/articles/data-types.html)).

## Learned today

- To escape backticks in Markdown, use double backticks and spaces:

  ```html
  `` ` ``
  ```

- I knew that primitive data types are immutable, but what happens if I reassign a variable like this:

  ```javascript
  let x = 'txt1';
  x = 'txt2';
  ```

  Right now I'm just guessing that behind the scenes `x` is not _modified_, but why?
