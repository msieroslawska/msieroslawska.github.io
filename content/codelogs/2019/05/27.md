## Plan for the day

- [ ] Implementation of a calendar-style archive for codelogs
  - [x] Figure out how to marry Jekyll and vanilla JS
  - [x] Populate the page with a full calendar using just JS
  - [x] Add hyperlinks for dates where codelogs exist
  - [ ] Style everything nicely in CSS, maybe with a dropdown selection for months
  - [ ] Add buttons for prev / next / show all simplified list, etc.
