## Learned today

### OOP

Is a popular paradigm to structure the code, which:

- makes it easy to add new features and functonalities (we don't have to rewrite stuff to add new features),
- is efficient in terms of memory,
- as a clear structure (easy for the author and othe developers).

If we are operating on some data and there are functionalities we'd like to apply to it, a nice and logical solution would be to store data and methods together in an object (**encapsulate**):

```javascript
let user1 = {
  name: 'Will',
  score: 6,
  increment: () => {
    user1.score++;
  },
};
```

There are other ways to declare objects:

```javascript
let user2 = {};
user2.name = 'Jim';
user2.score = 10;
user2.increment = () => {
  user2.score++;
};
```

```javascript
let user3 = Object.create(null);
user3.name = 'Jess';
user3.score = 2;
user3.increment = () => {
  user3.score++;
};
```

#### How do we avoid repeating ourselves?

1. Wrap in a function

```javascript
function userCreator(name, score) {
  let user = {};
  user.name = name;
  user.score = score;
  user.increment = () => {
    user.score++;
  };
  return user;
}

let user1 = userCreator('Will', 6);
let user2 = userCreator('Jess', 2);
user1.increment();
```

This approach has a fundamental flaw: what if we create 1000 users, and `userCreator` has 100 of different functions? Each of 1000 users would be a brand new object with new, separate function definitions. Do we need to allocate all that memory?

2. Use the prototypal nature of JS: when a method is not found in the object, JS looks for it in next object in the prototype chain. In this solution we are storing the common items (functions) in a separate store which we use to populate `userCreator`:

```javascript
function userCreator(name, score) {
  let user = Object.create(userFunctionStore);
  user.name = name;
  user.score = score;
  return user;
}

function userFunctionStore() {
  increment: () => { this.score++; },
  login: () => { console.log('You\'re logged in!'); },
}

let user1 = userCreator('Will', 6);
user1.increment();
```

`Object.create()` always returns an empty object. What is being passed as an argument is being stored as a reference in `user`'s `__proto__` property (creating a **prototype chain bond** ). What is being stored in `user1` (what is returned from `userCreator()`) does **not** have `increment()` and `login()`.
