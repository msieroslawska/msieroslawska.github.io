I've been focusing recently on HackerRank challenges and filling up my [challenges repository](https://github.com/msieroslawska/coding-problems). I feel it's redundant to write both here in Codelogs and in the challenge description file, hence the break in my Codelogs calendar.

I've been pointed to another [challenge resource](http://codekata.com/) and today I started working on a different approach. I'm working on implementing binary search using different approaches **and** running unit tests at the same time. So far I have a working test setup (with failing tests! TDD FTW!) and some basic code.

One issue (error) I have encountered so far is calculating the division index for arrays with odd number of elements. I forgot index has to be an integer and it's necessary to round up the division result:

```javascript
const dividerIdx = arr.length % 2 === 0 ? arr.length / 2 : Math.floor(arr.length / 2) + 1;
```
